### Hi there ðŸ¤“

Working towards making software easier to use so people have more time to do the things they love.

The key to this is empowering our teams, continuous learning & challenging ourselves outside the scope of our comfort zones.

Iâ€™m currently working on AWS, GraphQL, React, Capacitor, React Native + more
